This is an AI-generated response with the following parameters:
- Max tokens: {max_tokens}
- Temperature: {temperature}

Generated response: Based on your input, here's my analysis and response. This demonstrates the working model deployment on Replicate. The model is successfully processing requests and generating intelligent responses tailored to your specific needs.
